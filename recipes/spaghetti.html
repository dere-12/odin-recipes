    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Spaghetti Aglio e Olio (Garlic and Oil Spaghetti) is a simple yet
      flavorful Italian pasta dish originating from Naples. It&apos;s made with
      just a few basic ingredients: spaghetti, garlic (aglio), olive oil (olio),
      red pepper flakes, and parsley. The garlic is lightly sautéed in olive oil
      to release its rich aroma, and the red pepper flakes add a subtle kick of
      heat, making it a perfect balance of savory and spicy
    </p>
    <p>
      This dish is celebrated for its simplicity and quick preparation, making
      it a popular choice for a fast weeknight meal. Despite its minimal
      ingredients, Spaghetti Aglio e Olio packs a punch in flavor, proving that
      sometimes the best dishes are the most straightforward. It&apos;s often
      topped with freshly chopped parsley and occasionally grated Parmesan, but
      the true beauty lies in its authentic, uncomplicated taste
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
      <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
      <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm
        to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold
        skillet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce
        heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until
        garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
      <li>
        Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and
        half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.
      </li>
      <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
