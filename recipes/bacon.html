    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Million Dollar Bacon is a decadent and flavorful dish often served as an
      appetizer or brunch item. It features thick-cut bacon that is glazed with
      a sweet and spicy sauce, typically made from brown sugar, maple syrup,
      black pepper, and a hint of cayenne or chili flakes. The result is a
      perfect balance of savory, sweet, and a touch of heat, making each bite
      irresistible. The crispy bacon, combined with the rich glaze, offers a
      luxurious and indulgent experience that's become a popular dish in many
      upscale restaurants.
